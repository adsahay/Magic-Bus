<p id="desc">Originally named <strong>The Magic Bus</strong> after <a href="http://youtu.be/-2kgsVmd4bE">a great song by The Who</a>, <strong>Grooooovy</strong> (yes, that's five Os) was made as part of a session on <strong>Rapid Prototyping</strong> for startups at <a href="http://tlabs.indiatimes.com">TLabs</a> by <a href="http://sahay.co/about">me</a>, with the awesome psychedlic design thanks to <a href="http://navchatterji.com">Nav</a>. It takes a <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a> username, and based on the top artists scrobbled for that user, puts together a <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> playlist. The idea was to demonstrate how <a href="http://www.web2py.com">web2py</a> (Python-based web framework) could be used for quickly putting together a basic, functional app from scratch in an hour. The source code of this app is available on <a href="https://github.com/adsahay/Magic-Bus">Github</a>.</p>
